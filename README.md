#Introduction
_______________________________
Javascript was initially called livescript.It was initially created to make web pages live. can either be executed in any server or browser today

#what can javascript Do?

    -->Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
    -->React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
    -->Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
    -->Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
    -->Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).

    #What Makes Javascript unique
    -->Full integration with HTML/CSS.
    -->Simple things are done simply.
    -->Supported by all major browsers and enabled by defa

#Languages “over” JavaScript

Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent, actually allowing developers to code in another language and auto-converting it “under the hood”.

Examples of such languages:

    -CoffeeScript- -->is “syntactic sugar” for JavaScript. It introduces shorter syntax, allowing us to write clearer and more precise code. Usually, Ruby devs like it.
    TypeScript-->is concentrated on adding “strict data typing” to simplify the development and support of complex systems. It is developed by Microsoft.
    Flow also adds data typing, but in a different way. Developed by Facebook.
    Dart -->is a standalone language that has its own engine that runs in non-browser environments (like mobile apps), but also can be transpiled to JavaScript. Developed by Google.
    Brython -->is a Python transpiler to JavaScript that enables the writing of applications in pure Python without JavaScript.
    Kotlin -->is a modern, concise and safe programming language that can target the browser or Node.
#Summary

    --JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but it is now used in many other environments as well.
    --Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language, fully integrated with HTML/CSS.
   -- There are many languages that get “transpiled” to JavaScript and provide certain features. It is recommended to take a look at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.
